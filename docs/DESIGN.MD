# Design "Inter-view"
This document comtains notes regarding the design.

## General notes
Please note that the complete design is a 'guide' for the contents per page and flow of the application. Exact measurements will differ based on window/screen size and device. Form fields will be created in the correct datatype and validation will be demoed in the browser (probably next meeting Tuesday).

## Login screen
Will be 'skipped' when the app is functioning offline. The app will assume your identity based on the last visit.

## Script selection
Checkmarks show cache status. Green checkmarked scripts will be available for offline usage.

## Meta Pre & Post
Fields as configured will be shown, in their correct data type. Also, form validation will be added in-browser. Field requirement can be set in the settings.

## Meta Post w/o Interviewee
Obviously, the question item will repeat for each question in the script.

## Audio Testing
On most pages, a microphone icon is present. This will open the audio testing modal box ("onpage pop-up"). The microphone icon will reflect current audio level, as well as recording status.

## Interview
